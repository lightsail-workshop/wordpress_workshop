### What is Lightsail

Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started in the cloud. Lightsail provides compute, storage, and networking at a low fixed price. But, it doesn't stop there, your Lightsail instances are built on and can leverage the power of the rest of services that AWS offers. This means that you can start building more quickly than ever before, but are not limited in what you can do long term. 

#### Getting Started with Docker Containers on Amazon Lightsail
In these labs you will deploy a containerized LAMP stack application. First you'll create a new Lightsail Ubuntu intance as well as a Lightsail database. Then you'll install Docker onto the Lightsail instance, then you'll build the container for your Apache / PHP web front end. Next you'll run that container, and have it connect up to a Lightsail database instance.
